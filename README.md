# At the momment I am practicing:
#   - Creating repos with the [git init] command.
#   - Checking the status of any chnages with the [git status] command.
#   - Saving my interim work with the [git add . ] command.
#   - Officially saving my work with the [git commit -m "Type your message here"] command.
